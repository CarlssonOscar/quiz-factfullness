# Quiz Factfullness

Quiz factfulness is based up on the information in the book factfullness by Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling RÃ¶nnlund and Ola Rosling. The book is in part a guide which covers information about the world and common missconceptions about the world.
The quiz is for anyone curious about the worlds prerequisites and our often inacqurate world views.
